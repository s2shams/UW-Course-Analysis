He was funny and really helpful. Really understood the first year struggle,5.0,positive
Carey has really opened my eyes to chemistry. Not only is he a great professor but he raised a wonderful son. The best thing about his lectures are the hilarious punny chem jokes he makes throughout lectures. Great guy.,5.0,positive
Lectures are clear. He always come to the tutorials before tests. give good feedback.,4.0,positive
"I learned a lot about the very roots of chemistry in this course. We were able to derive and understand lots of the basic equations that we were given in general chemistry. I loved this course. Dr. Bissonnette was very knowledgeable and approachable, though lectures were slow. Time given for quizzes, and the final was not enough for me.",4.0,positive
He goes by the lecture material too slow and he goes off track almost every class. The midterm and quizzes were a disaster in which he tries to make up for the low class average by adding additional assignments to boost your grade. Not enough time to finish exam and also expects you to derive almost everything even though it's a chemistry course.,2.0,negative
"Bissonnette is definitely very knowledgeable on the subject of chemistry. When he describes a concept, he goes into great depth about it, to the point where the relevancy becomes questionable - although, it is very interesting and helpful. He is a tad bit hard to follow at times, but he is undoubtedly a really good prof and chemist.",4.5,positive
"He speaks very choppily, sometimes hard to follow and listen to for long lectures.",2.5,negative
he is the boringest prof i have ever had,1.0,negative
"He's really boring. Very slow too, talks about like 3 pages per lecture. Then rushes at the end where the tested material is located. Not the greatest in organization",1.5,negative
"He puts lecture videos online and give bonus questions on tests. I think he is not a born lecturer, but I think he has done everything he could to be a great prof.",5.0,positive
"Cares about you, speak to him for guidance...",5.0,positive
"He's a good prof. he explains things slowly and clearly so that you really get it. Sure, he goes slow through the material, but this isnt always a bad thing. Chem 120123 are not hard courses, but I highly recommend keeping up with material and doing textbook questions regularly. believe me, dont screw yourself over. chem is just practise.",3.5,neutral
"The podcasts are a little underwhelming - he doesn't quite explain the material that well. He does NOT respond to emails and can be quite unhelpful during office hours. I would recommend taking the campus version (CHEM 212) in the winter instead. The assignments are fair, but he takes forever to mark them - I actually still don't know what I got.",1.5,negative
Doesn't always seem overly interested,4.5,positive
"works through the course notes at a very very slow pace... he can go on about one small subject for over 20 minutes easily. it's way too easy to fall asleep in his class, but he seems like a nice guy. hated the clicker requirement in lectures, but he posted lecture videos. he is also open to answering questions after lectures.",3.5,neutral
"goes over what you need to know, however he teaches slowly and screws you for the lab. overall a pretty good professor",4.5,positive
"Bissonnette is a fatherly figure who will make sure you understand everything before moving on. While it's true that he goes very slowly (hence screwing you for 123L), he's the best first-year Chem prof you could get. He's entertaining, knows his stuff, and will give you very helpful midterm/exam hints. Focus on the concepts and you'll do well.",5.0,positive
"He goes slow, which is good for the most part but sometimes it can drive you crazy. He does explain things quite well and of course there is the bonus fact that he puts his lectures online. He's a pretty great prof...chose to have an 8:30 classes two terms in a row because he was teaching at that time. Can be entertaining at times also.",4.0,positive
"Very slow and clear, kinda boring",3.5,neutral
Great professor. He is always willing to give students help and he is very approachable.,4.5,positive
He moves very slowly through the material. He also doesn't give nearly enough time for students to completes tests/exams. He doesn't realize that it's pointless to make us crunch lots and lots of numbers with a calculator on an exam. It'll only frustrate the students and it doesn't show whether we understand the concepts.,3.0,neutral
"he is an excellent professor. extremely knowledgeable and passionate. However, he teaches teaches at an unbearably slow pace. Not only is his section at least a module and a half behind everyone else, he is also behind the lab material. During lab write ups i find myself cursing his name!",4.5,positive
"Good professor, easy to approach. Make friends with him early in your undergrad; he will help you out later in the end!",3.0,neutral
Amazing prof. Cares about his students and will often show up to lecture early to have the chance to talk to you about how your day is and what not. Explains the material real well and his concept questions really help!,5.0,positive
"Bissonnette is by far the best chem prof. Legitimately cares for his students, and there are so many opportunities to earn marks. Concept questions reinforced materials we just learned. Posts lots of practice, and gives fair warning about the exam. Its pretty easy to get 90+ in this course if you get off your butt and put some effort in.",4.5,positive
"Very good professor, cares about his students. Very recommended!",5.0,positive

"Best prof ever, take 120 and 123 with him! I regret not having him for 123. He is very helpful, gets to the point and doesn't go on talking about rubbish like some other profs. Always gives the best fatherly like advice! Overall, amazing prof and great course.",5.0,positive
"Good prof, easy to understand and always there to help if you ask for it. The course notes are a must.. they're super helpful for both class and studying for exams.. recommend getting those as well as going to class for sure!",4.5,positive
His teaching style is very relaxed while at the same time he spends a lot of time trying to make everyone in the class understand. He uses premade course notes which is awesome and his use of technology in class helps his lectures immensely.,5.0,positive
"He emphasizes weird words when he talks, and his lectures get boring really quickly! I liked chemistry before I attended his lectures. I ended up going to lectures. He doesn't make it as clear as the other professors, and it's hard to figure out what you NEED to know for exams/midterms.",2.0,negative
"Explains things really well, but his lectures can get dry and boring real quick.",4.5,positive
"The course notes for this course were very helpful. Lectures could get quite dry, but that was mostly due to material rather than the prof. Really nice guy.",5.0,positive
I wish a was an art student so i wouldn't have to sleep in his lectures. He is the master of saying stuff without saying anything. My telemarketer boss would be jealous.,2.0,negative
"He is very monotone and is a little bit boring. Midterms were fair, but should focus a little more on the theory. Get into Professor Marta's class if you can. Good looking and expressive.",3.0,neutral
"What a great prof. He got his phD from Cambridge University, so you don't get much smarter than that. He follows his course notes exactly, which is super helpful. He's approachable, reasonable, and just all around an entertaining and enthusiastic lecturer. Enjoy his classes, you won't get a much better prof than this.",5.0,positive
"Chem was never my favourite subject in high school, nor in university, until I started attending Bissonette's lectures. He is so interesting and the course notes are great. I never skip my chem lectures, I look forward to going to them too much!!",5.0,positive

Extremely helpful when students have difficulties in learning the material! Finds ways to accomodate to each individuals needs!,4.5,positive
"excellent prof. Like his lectures soooooo much, but the test is a little bit hard. don't trust the sample test.",5.0,positive
"Great prof. Goes through everything pretty slow, especially the basics. Not necessarily a bad thing, since for chem, you need to know the basics before you can actually understand the course.",4.0,positive
"Best and nicest prof ever!! like legit. not kidding. if you attend class everyday and actually follow/listen, expect > than a B",5.0,positive
I LOVE HIM,5.0,positive
"Great Prof. Have taken 120 with tchir and he was horrible, bissonette was the tutorial prof and he made things so much clearer! Also had 123 with him, hes a great prof, but found 123 harder. Hes a great prof, and very approachable if u need help!",5.0,positive
He is the best chemistry professor EVER,5.0,positive
"He is a great prof and his course notes are helpful. He's very organized and knows the material, he can truly deliver a lecture. The highlight of this course was his random jokes that are so ridiculous you just got to laugh. Midterm was really easy but somehow the class average for the exam was 40% (which resulted in a bell curve).",5.0,positive
"I think he's a great professor. He's organized, and teaches concisely to help you actually understand the material. He's a serious dude, but if there's any prof that has made me crack up this term it's definitely him. Well rounded overall.",4.5,positive
This guy treat DE students as if they are dumb. I email this dude and he never respond on time. Has a Phd and cant even tell whether a question make sense or not before posting. He is promoting his textbook so he can make money. Useless piece of crap,1.0,negative
"He's just not a smiley person, when he starts class he's serious business man. I suck at Mathcad programming and I think he can tell I'm a dumbo since he's always dropping by to see if I need any help without me asking for it, how thoughtful! His assignments are hard but he has realistic expectations. He and his tablet PC should elope together. <3",4.5,positive
Teaches with clarity and cracks up some good ones from time to time. Also iclickers,4.5,positive
best prof ever!!,5.0,positive
His online lecture has really bad arrangement on topics. You can't survive without a textbook cuz he sux at presenting his BRILLIANT idea,1.5,negative
"Material can get extremely difficult to follow if you fall even the slightest bit behind. He answers questions well and really wants you to succeed in the course, although he tells you that people do and will fail if they don't keep up. Modules are great, midterm was alright if you understood the concepts. Assignments and quizzes definitely helped.",5.0,positive
I honestly love this man. Best chem prof I've had and there's pretty much no way it gets any better than this. He deserves some sort of award. He probably already has one. He's that awesome.,5.0,positive
Took Chem 212DE and it was a breeze. too bad for students who didn't take this Fall 08 cause it's not going to be offerred again as DE. Suffer with Professor Sonny Lee ^_^,5.0,positive

"Best prof in science on campus hands down. Had him for 120/123, best classes ever. Don't need to do any work cause his lectures are all you need, you can just do assignments off that and own tests then. Material isn't really easy, but he makes it easy. Don't need book, he's the man, his style of notes are the best.",5.0,positive

Chem wasn't on my list of fav courses, but he made it so interesting and his lectures were always so much fun to attend. His clarity, care for his students and sense of humour make him my favourite prof.",5.0,positive
"Seriously, no joke, this man single handedly justifies my decision to go into Nanotechnology Engineering. He's the best. He's been able to answer all the questions I've had since high school and the ones I've developed here. I'm going to try to take any classes he's teaching as electives.

Jim Barby isn't even an engineer. He got an electronics diploma from Ryerson (when it was a community college) before somehow sneaking into a graduate program at Waterloo. He didn't go through the extremely hard work and extreme rigor of an engineering undergraduate program himself and then he's so hard on people who are. What a hypocrite.,1.0,negative
Jim Barby once badly failed most of a computer engineering class in an analog electronics course. The dept. told him to raise the marks. He refused. The result was most of the class had to repeat the term. Barby is so tough on students like he has something to prove because he didn't even do a bachelor's in engineering himself.,1.0,negative

"Lectures were next to impossible to follow, because he taught too fast and assumed that you can pick it up in less than a minute. Assignments had no solutions.
