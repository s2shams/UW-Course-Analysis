# University of Waterloo Course Analysis

Hi there, this is currently a project in progress. The following is a list of what is currently being worked on:
1. Data Visualization
2. Creating dashboards
3. Containerizing and deploying the application

## Problem Statement
UWFlow is a student-run platform for reviewing courses and professors, providing valuable insights to help students navigate their academic choices. This project aims to analyze the data to uncover trends related to courses with fewer ratings. Along the way, I also hope to answer some personal questions I have about specific departments. The goal is to identify ways to boost engagement on the platform by targeting underrepresented courses or demographics, ultimately enhancing its value to the student community.

## Technologies Used
The project is broken down into 5 major components.
1. Data Extraction: Selenium
2. Data Cleaning: Pandas
3. Data Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas
4. Data Dashboarding: Streamlit, Power BI
5. Containerization: Docker
