He was funny and really helpful. Really understood the first year struggle,5.0,positive
Carey has really opened my eyes to chemistry. Not only is he a great professor but he raised a wonderful son. The best thing about his lectures are the hilarious punny chem jokes he makes throughout lectures. Great guy.,5.0,positive
Lectures are clear. He always come to the tutorials before tests. give good feedback.,4.0,positive
"I learned a lot about the very roots of chemistry in this course. We were able to derive and understand lots of the basic equations that we were given in general chemistry. I loved this course. Dr. Bissonnette was very knowledgeable and approachable, though lectures were slow. Time given for quizzes, and the final was not enough for me.",4.0,positive
He goes by the lecture material too slow and he goes off track almost every class. The midterm and quizzes were a disaster in which he tries to make up for the low class average by adding additional assignments to boost your grade. Not enough time to finish exam and also expects you to derive almost everything even though it's a chemistry course.,2.0,negative
"Bissonnette is definitely very knowledgeable on the subject of chemistry. When he describes a concept, he goes into great depth about it, to the point where the relevancy becomes questionable - although, it is very interesting and helpful. He is a tad bit hard to follow at times, but he is undoubtedly a really good prof and chemist.",4.5,positive
"He speaks very choppily, sometimes hard to follow and listen to for long lectures.",2.5,negative
he is the boringest prof i have ever had,1.0,negative
"He's really boring. Very slow too, talks about like 3 pages per lecture. Then rushes at the end where the tested material is located. Not the greatest in organization",1.5,negative
"He puts lecture videos online and give bonus questions on tests. I think he is not a born lecturer, but I think he has done everything he could to be a great prof.",5.0,positive
"Cares about you, speak to him for guidance...",5.0,positive
"He's a good prof. he explains things slowly and clearly so that you really get it. Sure, he goes slow through the material, but this isnt always a bad thing. Chem 120123 are not hard courses, but I highly recommend keeping up with material and doing textbook questions regularly. believe me, dont screw yourself over. chem is just practise.",3.5,neutral
"The podcasts are a little underwhelming - he doesn't quite explain the material that well. He does NOT respond to emails and can be quite unhelpful during office hours. I would recommend taking the campus version (CHEM 212) in the winter instead. The assignments are fair, but he takes forever to mark them - I actually still don't know what I got.",1.5,negative
Doesn't always seem overly interested,4.5,positive
"works through the course notes at a very very slow pace... he can go on about one small subject for over 20 minutes easily. it's way too easy to fall asleep in his class, but he seems like a nice guy. hated the clicker requirement in lectures, but he posted lecture videos. he is also open to answering questions after lectures.",3.5,neutral
"goes over what you need to know, however he teaches slowly and screws you for the lab. overall a pretty good professor",4.5,positive
"Bissonnette is a fatherly figure who will make sure you understand everything before moving on. While it's true that he goes very slowly (hence screwing you for 123L), he's the best first-year Chem prof you could get. He's entertaining, knows his stuff, and will give you very helpful midterm/exam hints. Focus on the concepts and you'll do well.",5.0,positive
"He goes slow, which is good for the most part but sometimes it can drive you crazy. He does explain things quite well and of course there is the bonus fact that he puts his lectures online. He's a pretty great prof...chose to have an 8:30 classes two terms in a row because he was teaching at that time. Can be entertaining at times also.",4.0,positive
"Very slow and clear, kinda boring",3.5,neutral
Great professor. He is always willing to give students help and he is very approachable.,4.5,positive
Please stop inflicting this man on the students.,1.0,negative
"by far the worst prof i've had in all of my undergrad and graduate career. he doesn't care about students, he doesn't care about teaching. he cares about showing how smart he is. instead of explaining material clearly, he will give you the most convoluted content to figure out on your own. and he will call you out for your mistakes publicly.",1.0,negative
"Thought you retired, but you are like the energizer bunny, I shall wait to see the battery run out. OK lets Try 1V instead of 3.3V. Surprising You can function with 0V too.",1.0,negative
Terrible professor,1.0,negative
"One of the few courses I finished and actually felt like I learned something useful. Barby has some issues in his methods (flies through notes yet somehow has time for four lectures of ""Q/A""), and you'll hate him during the term. That is, until you realize he cares more about making us good engineers than passing us with high grades.",5.0,positive
"Puts all other professors i considered bad to shame. Will not hesitate to fail an entire class and will do absolutely nothing to prepare you for the exam. If you manage to pass, be ready to move on from his course having gained zero useful knowledge other than how to deal with incredible stress.",1.0,negative
Pretty bad,1.0,negative
"One of the best professors. He will motivate you to study. He knows the material really well. It was hard to follow his lectures but he gives you a lot of practice problems. This course will prepare you well for future circuit courses. Make sure to do all the assignments, attend tutorials and ask him for help during office hours.",5.0,positive
"One of the best professors I have ever had. At first glance he may seem rough and rude. But it took me a co-op term after the course to understand the worth of what he teaches and why he goes hard on the students. His grading scheme may seem gargantuan but irl, it lets you get 90s easily. Real gem, knows how to make his students good at EE design.",5.0,positive
"""Who let him in the college!? While is he still in the college? When will he leave the college?Why would he let anyone be taught by him in the college? Why would he grade anyone in the college!? "" These are the questions that pop out In my head more than the semester questions....",1.0,negative
Not a good person. Mocks a lot!! Should be give resignation ASAP!,1.0,negative
"I'm sorry but I don't understand why the department in nano eng. dont see why this guy shouldn't be a professor. Maybe he's good at a researcher, but as a lecturer, he's terrible.",1.0,negative
"Arrogant, prone to shouting if mad, simply does not care if you fail. In fact, seems as though he WANTS you to. If you can avoid him, don't just walk away - RUN.",1.0,negative
RUN,1.0,negative

Can't teach anything. None of the students can follow his lectures.,1.0,negative

James Barby is a total sick baller OG.,5.0,positive
Difficult course and hard exams but I guarantee you will know how to design circuits after taking this course. Very well taught.,4.5,positive
Guys got a big heart and takes it really easy on first and second years. Very good lecturer and speaker.,5.0,positive
"Best prof ive had so far, highly respected for his yeaching abilities",5.0,positive
"Wasn't even in his section, but watching his lecture videos got me a 90. Seems to genuinely care about the success of his students. Amazing guy.",5.0,positive
DO NOT call him Richard! Other than that 10/10 best prof I've ever had.,5.0,positive
HE IS AWESOME,5.0,positive
"tbh dont see what all the hype is about, hes okay but definetly not as good as ive heard. avoid asking questions during lecture as hell rush through it and might not even answer it properly so go to him after or during office hours but yeah very average nothing special.",3.0,neutral
I had a terrible experience in his class. He doesn't like being asked questions. I would not recommend his class or teaching methods.,1.0,negative
"Rick Marta is by far my favourite prof in my undergrad career. For some, chemistry is not an appealing subject but Rick Marta makes an effort to get you excited about learning through his passion for chemistry. This course is difficult if you don't keep up with lectures but Rick records all his lectures so you never miss a thing. Great guy.",5.0,positive
He honestly seems like he loves teaching,5.0,positive
"Great professor! So helpful, does a really good job of making sure things are clear in lecture. He posts lecture videos, annotated notes, and practice quiz answers, lots of resources to help you do well.",5.0,positive
"I only watched his online videos and got a 100%, even if you aren't in his section his videos are available. Do all the practice questions in the course notebook and don't worry too much about assignments (understand them and do them as they are worth 10%) but his tests do not exhibit the difficulty of the assignments. Best prof at UW.",5.0,positive
he is awesome and makes clear and precise lectures!,5.0,positive
"Strongly unrecommended. He was extremely rude in person and in emails if students had questions. He did get better with time, but there was no reason to be rude in the first place. Being a professor (lecturer!) does not give anyone a blank card to be imperious.",1.0,negative
"Marta was definitely the best first-year prof I had. His classes are unreal and he's great at explaining tough material. Go to his office hours if you don't understand something and he'll make sure you do. Great guy, wish him the best.",5.0,positive
"So-so. Don't think he has a nice voice - I think his way of speaking is actually unsophisticated and needs to be more academic. As a lab instructor, I found him to be labile in his personality. Overall, I wouldn't recommend him. However, he can be nice with more interaction.",2.0,negative
"His voice is nice, and posts lectures online",4.0,positive
"Quite dismissive of a student if they ask questions and tries to make it seem like they didn't have good background knowledge. He's not bad when it comes to asking for extensions, but that's about it. Wouldn't recommend him because he is overrated and has communication issues - lacks civility.",2.0,negative
"He is a really nice guy. He is really easy to approach and really understanding. However, he goes on long tangents that have nothing to do with what we are being tested on. We could do the entire course in half the time if he didn't ramble so much. It is sometimes hard to know what they want you to know for the exams.",3.0,neutral
Unrecommended.,1.0,negative
"Amazing prof! Had him for chem 120, 123 and chem 266l. He really knows his stuff and is great at explaining. For chem 266L, the lab environment is super chill and labs never take the full 3 hours plus no lab final.",5.0,positive
"Makes the course very difficult, but never in an unfair way.",4.0,positive
Definitely the best professor I have had in all my schooling. He has an ocean of knowledge. He tries his absolute level best to ensure that you understand even the most simple ideas. Very kind and gentle person.,5.0,positive
"He did not give lectures while we were online. He did office hours. If we had any question, no matter how trivial it may be or how close to an assignment question it may be, he would help us with great enthusiasm and no hint of any judgement. If we didn't have any questions, he would spend the office hours going over the textbook material.",5.0,positive
"Does not lecture, provides course notes + office hours instead. Wouldn't be too big of a deal but his course notes barely contain any examples. I counted 29 theorems/defs to 1 example in the notes for chp2 and 36 theorems/defs to 0 examples for chp. Maybe I'm a moron but seriously considering a WD (for the first time ever)",1.0,negative
Don't understand why this guy is a professor if he refuses to teach. Do not take online classes with him. Provides no lectures or videos and comes up with some bs excuses as to why he doesn't.,1.0,negative
"In Spring 2021, I took PMATH 351 with Stephen New. Every week I spent several days on his notes but rarely learnt anything. Don't take his class if you truly want to learn something!!",1.0,negative
"I took his PMATH 365 and PMATH 351, however, for both two courses I have not learnt anything to be honest. He had no lecture videos but just posted his awful notes. I spent very long time on his 365 notes but still could not understand the concept. His notes are really tedious without motivation as if I was reading the dictionary.",1.0,negative
He just posts tedious notes on Learn and you can hardly learn anything. Assignments are long and hard but marginally related to core concepts. 1 out of 5 because there is no 0 :(,1.0,negative
"He does not post lecture videos during this online class, but his notes are extremely clear. If you do not understand a concept, please make a post on Piazza because he goes to great lengths to explain a concept. I did not attend office hours, but he is probably useful there too. Grading: 5 Assignments and very hard, but he gives hints for them :)",5.0,positive
Avoid him online if possible. No videos given only super long and confusing lecture notes. His reponse to demand for videos is that you should read the recommended text and spend more time. Why am I paying the tuition if I can learn everything from by myself a textbook?,1.0,negative
"Due to COVID, I haven't had the pleasure of doing a course with Prof. New in person. I took this course online where lecture notes were provided and five assignments were posted each due two weeks apart. The overall grade was based on the assignments alone. Prof. New responded to everyone's questions on Piazza and provided articulate explanations.",4.0,positive
The man who is well-known as a beauty in mathematics.,5.0,positive
"When you watch Professor New teach, it is evident that he is in love with math. And this really gets flushed out over the course of a term. He knows his stuff upside down and backwards. He is a wonderful teacher, and although he comes up with the most difficult questions possible, he will adjust your marks fairly. He is a very nice man.",5.0,positive
Respect.,5.0,positive
Super Knowledgable. Great man.,5.0,positive
The man is a legend.,5.0,positive
"Ah, legend. Without a doubt his class is the hardest out of all my first year courses. The content is harder than 147 but it is easier to get a good mark on a 145 exam because Marcoux does not curve 147 whatsoever. He is very patient, very helpful, EXTREMELY helpful, and if you genuiely like math, you will not be bored despite his monotone voice.",5.0,positive
Great prof!,5.0,positive
"Really Good prof. The lecture contains the right amount of stuff that one doesn't feel that it's too much while he has to be super active to catch up with the pace. Meanwhile he explains stuff clearly and he's mostly free after class. Although this lecture is at eight thirty in the morning, I don't feel like missing any one of the lectures!",5.0,positive
simply the most knowlegable prof I had ever seen,5.0,positive
"Tough as a teacher but fair, really helped me out when I messed up on one of the participation and has worked with me to get my grades in even though I forgot to change the iClicker email. The content is pretty fair and straight forward and everything you would need is in the lecture slides and you would need to explain it more than how she would.",5.0,positive
she was stern and had high expectation for excellence. so do your work as you should and you will be just fine! great prof and lots of great information.,5.0,positive
"- 4yr student --> at least 5 Duxbury labs - confusing lab manuals (1 TA said the manual needed revision. Another admitted she struggled understanding it too) - sometimes hella confusing lab report guidelines (eg Biol 354L, spring '23) - does nothing in lab sessions. TAs are informally the ones in charge (prelab work, lab briefings, grading reports)",1.0,negative
"Very confusing lab reports, information to complete them is in all different places, rude and disrespectful to students.",1.0,negative
"I personally have never disliked a professor in any way in my 3+ years of university until this prof. She comes into our lab sessions and harshly criticizes our work. Its one thing to tell you when you did something wrong, its another when she makes you feel stupid and embarrasses you in front of your peers. The learning environment is unpleasant.",1.0,negative
"Really, really rude. Like surprisingly and so unnecessarily rude ALL the time. She's unpleasant to work with and be around, and faculty and students know it very well.",1.0,negative
Not very good. Final exam was made very hard. No practice quizzes or tests to study from.,1.0,negative
Extremely rude and treats students terribly. The way she sets up the course is like she wants people to fail. She humiliates students in front of their peers and everyone I've talked to is afraid of asking her for any sort of help or clarification because she is so unapproachable. Avoid this prof at all costs.,1.0,negative
Incredibly rude. Avoid taking any class with her.,1.0,negative
There are many strange requirement and the grade she gave is very very low.,1.0,negative
"bio 355 was one of the most information dense courses I've taken. Duxbury is a very blunt and straightforward. She can come across very cold but she is 100% fair. the class was 30% midterm and 55% final. she make the final online to make life easier, so nice. She is a hard marker and does look for the details but If you try, you'll be fine",4.0,positive
"So rude. Sent her a kind email about missing a lab and got an email back with no hello or sign off and sent from her iphone. Incoherent and misspelled just like the lab manual. She didn't understand why I thought section A students couldn't make up a lab in section B. It's written in the lab manual! Such disrespect, its crazy. Avoid her!",1.0,negative
Very rude. Its her way or the highway.,2.0,negative
"After taking three labs run by her, Cheryl Duxbury is one of the worst individuals I've experienced so far in university. I've barely met her in person, but the couple times I have have been nightmares and her self-importance, passive-aggressiveness, and lack of caring toward her students come across clearly in every possible aspect of her courses.",1.0,negative
"She is arrogant and condescending, don't bother asking for help or clarification, lab manual has so many errors and she doesn't even care to correct them before printing, she really needs an anger management course or taught how to teach and be kind to students. She is the absolute worst. Dragana is an angel compared to her",1.0,negative
"If you do not have to take a class with her please don't. She is very arrogant,made gerontology harder than it had to be, has anger management issues and will quickly yell at students in class, a 4th grader has better grammatical structure when it comes to her lectures and posts. She is an all around horrible person, beware and stay away!!!",1.0,negative
too much experiments to do in one lab,1.0,negative
"One of the RUDEST professors I've ever encountered at the University of Waterloo. She is condescending and disrespectful. Will easily get angry at students when they reach out for help, questions, or even to pick up lab reports. Even her TAs dread talking to her. Her lab manual is riddled with mistakes and has obviously not been edited. Avoid!",1.0,negative
"Her lab manuals contain a lot of mistakes, so watch out for those! If you were thinking of asking her questions in office hours, you're better off not doing so, as she will only put you down and be rude. Biggest advice: Try taking the lab component with another instructor.",1.0,negative
"Literally says ""More often than not"" in every sentence. LONG exams and you have to write exactly what she's looking for or you're not going to get the marks you believe you want and when you talk to her about it she'll be rude about everything. Rude during exams too. If you're going to ask a question get ready to hear ""you should know this""",1.0,negative

"Pure Lao B Deng. Hard tests with extensive, tricky problems. Always keep an eye on the tut materials.",1.0,negative
"He uses slides for this course but there are still quite a lot of written notes. His notes are a bit disorganized and his writing is a bit messy, but that's about it. 2 assignments and 2 midterms, both very easy. He's nice and caring and very engaging. He explains the material very well. Would take again",5.0,positive
"midterms are super fair, assignments a bit complicated, but he gives good lectures. he says you may need the textbook but his notes and practice papers are enough",5.0,positive
"Don't know why his reviews are so low. He's literally one of the best lecturers I've come across. He actually wants to be here and teach, which is a first. He is also engaging. He's super nice and friendly and gives very very easy midterms almost identical to practice ones. His notes are a bit disorganized, but the material sin't that hard anyways.",4.0,positive
"I used to avoid Freeland bcoz of boring lecture from second year ACTSC class, however taking MATBUS 470 with him made me change my mind. The course is pretty easy, nothing too theoretical, 2 midterms and 2 assignments are really easy, he gives a lot of examples and walk you through all the theory. it seems that he genuinely care about student",5.0,positive
"Definitely a dry professor, but he actually is very funny - people just can't tell whether he's making a sarcastic joke or being serious. This class isn't really that hard but people don't do the practice so our midterm averages were super low. Overall he teaches us what we need to know, and pretty good at answering questions if you ask after class",3.0,neutral
"I took this online, so can't speak too much to teaching style. His organizations and material for the online course were solid. With regards to his reputation of giving brutal exams, I think that is very subjective. My experience (looking at multiple terms of exams) is that he tested very fairly, students just need to put in the work with practice.",4.0,positive
